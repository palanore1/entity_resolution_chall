# Technical Journey: Entity Resolution Process Development

## Initial Challenges

When I first approached the entity resolution problem, I faced several key challenges:

1. **Scale**: The dataset contained thousands of company records, making pairwise comparison computationally expensive
2. **Data Quality**: Inconsistent formatting, missing values, and various name formats
3. **Performance**: Need for a solution that could process the data in a reasonable time
4. **Accuracy**: Need to balance between finding all duplicates and avoiding false positives

## First Attempt: Basic Approach

initial approach was straightforward but inefficient:

```python
# Initial naive approach
for i in range(len(companies)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(companies)):
        similarity = jaro_winkler(companies[i].name, companies[j].name)
        if similarity > 0.90:
            mark_as_duplicate(i, j)
```

**Problems Encountered:**
1. Runtime was O(n²), making it impractical for large datasets ->  approx. 1.1 B comparisons ; 0.05 ms per comp ⇒ 833 mins to compare all the records
2. High false positive rate due to simple similarity threshold
3. Missing many duplicates due to name variations
4. No consideration of business context

## First Breakthrough: Blocking Strategy

The first major improvement came with implementing blocking:

```python
# First blocking implementation
blocks = {}
for company in companies:
    # Block by country and first word
    key = f"{company.country}_{company.name.split()[0]}"
    if key not in blocks:
        blocks[key] = []
    blocks[key].append(company)
```

**Why This Worked:**
1. Reduced comparisons from O(n²) to O(n) within each block
2. Leveraged domain knowledge (companies in same country more likely to be duplicates)
3. First word of company name often indicates business type

**Limitations Found:**
1. Some blocks were too large
2. Missing cross-country duplicates
3. No consideration of industry context

## Second Breakthrough: Multi-Metric Similarity

then improved the similarity calculation:

```python
def compute_similarity(name1, name2):
    # Use different metrics based on name length
    if len(name1.split()) <= 3 or len(name2.split()) <= 3:
        return jaro_winkler(name1, name2)
    else:
        return tfidf_cosine_similarity(name1, name2)
```

**Why This Worked:**
1. Jaro-Winkler better for short names and typos
2. TF-IDF better for longer names and semantic similarity
3. Word overlap ratio helps with partial matches

**Challenges Overcome:**
1. Different name formats handled better
2. Reduced false positives
3. Better handling of business terms

## Third Breakthrough: Industry-Specific Rules

noticed that different industries needed different matching rules:

```python
industry_thresholds = {
    "Restaurants": 0.80,  # More variations in restaurant names
    "Accommodation": 0.80,
    "Real Estate": 0.85,
    "Default": 0.90
}
```

**Why This Worked:**
1. Restaurants often have location-specific names
2. Real estate companies need stricter matching
3. Industry context improves accuracy

## Fourth Breakthrough: Graph-Based Clustering

The introduction of graph-based clustering was crucial:

```python
G = nx.Graph()
for match in matches:
    G.add_edge(match["idx1"], match["idx2"], 
               similarity=match["similarity"])
components = list(nx.connected_components(G))
```

**Why This Worked:**
1. Handles transitive relationships (A=B, B=C → A=C)
2. More robust than pairwise matching
3. Better handles complex duplicate patterns

## Fifth Breakthrough: Comprehensive Blocking

expanded blocking strategy:

```python
# Multiple blocking keys
block_keys = [
    f"country_{country}_word_{first_word}",
    f"website_{domain}",
    f"phone_{prefix}",
    f"location_{country}_{city}",
    f"industry_{industry}_{sector}",
    f"business_model_{model}",
    f"name_{first_two}"
]
```

**Why This Worked:**
1. Multiple perspectives on similarity
2. Better coverage of different duplicate patterns
3. Reduced false negatives

## Performance Optimizations

Several key optimizations were crucial:

1. **Similarity Caching**:
```python
similarity_cache = {}
if cache_key in similarity_cache:
    return similarity_cache[cache_key]
```

2. **Block Size Limits**:
```python
if len(block) > 100:
    continue  # Skip oversized blocks
```

3. **Early Stopping**:
```python
if max_similarity >= threshold:
    break  # Stop comparing once good match found
```

## Analysis Tools Development

developed analysis tools to validate the approach:

1. **Blocking Analysis**:
   - Shows coverage of blocking strategy
   - Identifies gaps in blocking
   - Helps optimize block sizes

2. **Match Quality Analysis**:
   - Validates match accuracy
   - Shows distribution of similarity scores
   - Identifies potential issues

## Key Learnings

1. **Data Understanding is Crucial**:
   - Understanding business context improved matching
   - Industry-specific rules were essential
   - Location and business type matter

2. **Performance vs. Accuracy Trade-off**:
   - Blocking strategy balanced both
   - Caching improved performance
   - Multi-metric approach improved accuracy

3. **Validation is Essential**:
   - Analysis tools helped identify issues
   - Quality metrics guided improvements
   - Continuous validation improved results

## Current Solution Strengths

1. **Efficiency**:
   - O(n) comparisons within blocks
   - Cached similarity scores
   - Optimized block sizes

2. **Accuracy**:
   - Multiple similarity metrics
   - Industry-specific rules
   - Comprehensive validation

3. **Robustness**:

   - Works across industries
   - Handles missing data

## Future Considerations

1. **Machine Learning**:
   - Could improve similarity scoring
   - Might help with threshold selection
   - Could handle edge cases better

2. **Performance**:
   - Parallel processing possible
   - More efficient data structures
   - Better memory management

3. **Accuracy**:
   - More sophisticated validation rules
   - Better handling of edge cases
   - Improved analysis tools

## Conclusion

1. Understanding the problem domain
2. Iterative improvements
3. Performance optimization
4. Validation and analysis
5. Continuous refinement

The final solution balances:
- Performance (reasonable runtime)
